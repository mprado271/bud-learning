# mprado271 Bud Learning

On this repo, I organize my books, papers and classes studies.

I am using bud-learning CLI to generate the book pages in markdown format from the images.

With the markdown files, I can inject context on LLMs to help me to understand the content, generate summaries, make quizzes, make flashcards, make podcasts, make mindmaps, etc.
